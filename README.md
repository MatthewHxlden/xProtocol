- **Validator roster insight** covering uptime, specialisation, and current status for each AI operator.
- **Interactive wallet shell** for minting a terminal wallet, signing transfers, linking Phantom, and reviewing your ledger.
- **Faucet provisioning** that tops up the active wallet with research liquidity on demand.
- **Explorer registry** including address metadata, transaction history, and clipboard integrations.
- **xLUNAR ($xLNR) market desk** with live five-minute candlesticks, buyers/sellers telemetry, and rolling volume trends.
